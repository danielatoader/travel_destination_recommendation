Even a short visit is worthwhile, as it's an easy hop from the capital of Reykjavík to unforgettable day-trip excursions: The famous Golden Circle route, studded with geysers and thundering waterfalls; the South Coast with its glaciers, black beaches, and jagged volcanic landscape; and of course the famous Blue Lagoon thermal baths. Those with more time thrill to the 800-mile Ring Road that circles the entire island. Yet Iceland's otherworldly magic comes not so much from its abundance of natural splendors but from its people's strong connection to their landscape, where it seems every rock has a thousand-year-old name and a legend to go along with it.\"},\n",

Once called Byzantium, then Constantinople, Istanbul boasts the opulent trappings of an epic past — from the Byzantine emperors and the Ottoman sultans of distant ages, to the modern Republic-builders and \"Eurocrats\" of our own time. And, as the biggest city of a moderate Muslim nation, Istanbul also offers the inquisitive traveler a unique opportunity to grapple with the rich and inspiring Islamic faith: Hear the eerie wail of the call to prayer echo across the rooftops, poke into a neighborhood mosque, and watch a dervish whirl in prayer. Set sail on the Golden Horn, and take in a spine-tingling skyline bristling with minarets.'},\n",
